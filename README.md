# Movie_Budget_Analysis

## Overview
We are working for Netflix on budgeting for our new Netflix special. Using the data from 45,000 movies so we can answer these questions:
 - Which genres are rated the most successful based on budget vs income?
 - Based on the revenue, are movies filmed in foreign countries more popular than movies filmed in the USA?
 - Does the overall budget have any influence of the overall rating?
