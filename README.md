# Movie_Budget_Analysis

## Overview
We are working for Netflix on a new Netflix special. We were tasked with finding the range of budget we would need, which production compnay that the should work with based on how profittable and popular it is, and which genre of movies are the most popular. Using the data from 45,000 movies so we can answer these questions:

 - Which genres are rated the most successful based on budget vs income?
 - Based on the revenue, are movies filmed in foreign countries more popular than movies filmed in the USA?


## Results

### Successful Genres (Based off profit)

### Popularity: Foreign vs US

###### Using machine learning we are able to see the prediction on how well a movie will do based on its budget

###### as shown above our machine learning model was able to have an 82% accuracy return.


## Summary
Based on our findings movies that have a higher budget are more popular and have a higher profit from the general public. In the future to amke our results better we would consider finding more that one dataset based on our topic which we decided against because our current dataset was 45,000 records. Also, we would try to find a dataset that included whether or not the movie won any type of movie award to compare the popularity between the general public and the movie critics.
