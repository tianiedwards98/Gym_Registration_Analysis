# Movie_Budget_Analysis

## Overview
We are working for Netflix on budgeting for our new Netflix special. Using the data from the Top 100 movies from 2003-2022 we are answer these questions:
 - Which genres are the most successful in 20 years span based on budget vs income?
 - How do different rated movies film in different countries perform according to income?
 
Hypotheses:
- Action movies tend to have a better budget to income ratio than other genres
